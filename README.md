# Anarchist Library Ripper

Script to automatically download all texts hosted at [The Anarchist Library](https://theanarchistlibrary.org/library) in pdf format.

## Usage

* Run `ripper.py` to begin downloading texts. Texts will be saved to `texts\` by default within the directory the script is executed from. 
* To save texts in a different folder, provide the name of folder as a command line argument (e.g `ripper.py files`)

Executing the script will only download texts that are not already saved. Run script again to download new texts uploaded to the library.
